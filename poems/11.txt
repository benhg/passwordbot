When My Name is Clyfford

By Sophie March, '19

I am so handsome.
Don’t I look like my dad, when
   he was twenty and tall and
   grinning amidst
the green beans of his mother’s
   garden?
When his hair was short and his
   hands were calloused and
he was grinning.

Don’t I look like my dad and
   aren’t I handsome?
I look at the ankles of the boy
   sitting across from me,
his shoulders.
Do I look like the boy sitting
   across from me?
I cross my ankles, like him.

Do I look like my dad?
I am almost twenty-two.
My hair is short and my hands
   are soft,
but in the summer I will make
   them hard and calloused.
In the summer the green beans
   will flower.
In the summer I will look like
   my dad.
