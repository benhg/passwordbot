Credo

By Alfred Kreymborg (1883-1966)

I sing the will to love:
the will that carves the will to
   live,
the will that saps the will to
   hurt,
the will that kills the will to
   die;
the will that made and keeps you
   warm,
the will that points your eyes
   ahead,
the will that makes you give,
   not get,
a give and get that tell us what
   you are:
how much a god, how much a
   human.
I call on you to live the will
   to love.
