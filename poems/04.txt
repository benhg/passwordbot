San Ramon

By Riley Danger Brawn, '22

That summer in San Ramon, colors
   of yellow and green were at
   every corner:
avocados, mangos, chipping
   paint, rolling jungle hills,
   butterflies.
I walked past whistles and went
   deep into the neighborhood to
   the bakery with flies. I went
   out onto dirt roads with
   Juancito, placing skinned knees
   and elbows where they belonged.
   Fear took control of my bones,
   where people spoke in tongues at
   me in the dark. I always wished
   I had known the language. They
   brought me nutella and eggs,
   rabbits and dogs, coconuts and
   white pineapple. They washed my
   clothes and set my bed. They
   took me to the coffee plantation
   where I got bees stuck in my
   curls. My host mama, hermano,
   hermana, abuelo, abuela, tia,
   tio, y perro.
My days started with black
   coffee and Juancito’s cheeky
   smile. He joined us to eat jello
   from a bag, drink juice from a
   bucket, and eat rice from a pot.
   Juan walked me from the house to
   the hut of planting hope, as if
   he were older than me. He gave
   me his jacket often, though two
   sizes too small.
We lay on the roof of the
   crumbling building on a towel,
   looking at the sky’s unpolluted
   stars.
Bug spray in the air. “Te voy a
   extranar,” he cried.
