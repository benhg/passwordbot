dirty dust (der/die/das)

By Ezri Reyes, '22

I live between the fluidity of
   nothing at all
and vastness of everything ever

Maybe bc there is something
   !there! in the blackness
(not the darkness).
Where white isn't light
and left is always right.
I keep myself tucked
in bed and in check,
tightly buckled to an ejected
   seat
from an escape pod of a
   rocket-ship.
When day is just night;
The kids !are! alright.
I want to be loved
I need to be fucked

I'll buy you some boba with my
   haircut money
