Sloth

By Stephen Hanley, '20

Sounds are sweeter underwater.
Long sighs diffuse in darkling
   green
Or drown with light's lost
   shimmer.
The bloated bodies wash to sea
How crowded now the banks
   beneath.

i burble neath the silt. it
   fills my lungs
try laudanum to soothe the songs
   unsung.
though thrashing churns the
   surface far above
we sleep eternal buried in the
   mud.
