The Caterpillar
Robert Graves


Under this loop of honeysuckle,
A creeping, coloured
  caterpillar,
I gnaw the fresh green
  hawthorn spray,
I nibble it leaf by leaf away.


Down beneath grow dandelions,
Daisies,
  old-mans-looking-glasses;
Rooks flap croaking across the
  lane.
I eat and swallow
  and eat again.


Here come raindrops
  helter-skelter;
I munch and nibble unregarding:
Hawthorn leaves
  are juicy and firm.
Ill mind my business:
  Im a good worm.


When Im old, tired,
  melancholy,
Ill build
  a leaf-green mausoleum
Close by, here
  on this lovely spray,
And die and dream the ages
  away.


Some say
  worms win resurrection,
With white wings beating
  flitter-flutter,
But wings or a sound sleep,
  why should I care?
Either way Ill miss my share.


Under this loop of honeysuckle,
A hungry, hairy caterpillar,
I crawl on my
  high and swinging seat,
And eat, eat, eat
  as one ought to eat.
