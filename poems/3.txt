In the Night Desert
William Stafford, 1914-1993


The Apache word for love twists
then numbs the tongue:
Uttered once clear, said -
never that work again.

“Cousin,” you call, or "Sister" and one
more word that spins
In the dust: a talk-flake
chipped like obsidian.

The girl who hears this flake and
follows you into the dark
Turns at a touch: the night desert
forever behind her back.
