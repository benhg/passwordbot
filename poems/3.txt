In the night desert
William Stafford


The Apache word for love twists
then numbs the tongue:
Uttered once clear, said -
never that work again.


“Cousin,”
  you call, or "Sister" and one
more word that spins
In the dust: a talk-flake
chipped like obsidian.


The girl
  who hears this flake and
follows you into the dark
Turns at a touch:
  the night desert
forever behind her back.
