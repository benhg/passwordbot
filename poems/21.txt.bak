Rain

By: Jean Starr Untermeyer, 1886-1970

I have always hated the rain,
And the gloom of grayed skies.
But now I think I must always
cherish Rain-hung leaf and the
misty river; And the friendly
screen of dripping green Where
eager kisses were shyly given
And your pipe-smoke made clouds
in our damp, close heaven. The
curious laggard passed us by,
His wet shoes soughed on the
shining walk. And that afternoon
was filled with a blurred gloryâ€”
That afternoon, when we first
talked as lovers.
