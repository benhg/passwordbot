The Dark Hills

By Edwin Arlington Robinson
   (1869-1935)

Dark hills at evening in the
   west,
Where sunset hovers like a sound
Of golden horns that sang to
   rest
Old bones of warriors under
   ground,
Far now from all the bannered
   ways
Where flash the legions of the
   sun,
You fadeas if the last of days
Were fading, and all wars were
   done.
