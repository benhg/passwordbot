The Honey-Moon

By: Bradley Ralph, '19

Mommy held my hand as we walked
up the steps, “We’re going to
the honey-moon,” she said in the
dark. “Just me and your dad.” As
the red lights of the Camry
disappeared into the night I
cried while my protectors flew
beyond my sight. Granny held me
close in her room, as I lay
above the covers Staring out
between the iron columns welded
to the window, Up at the moon.
Eyes tired, transfixed upon the
sharp cheddar disc that hung
above and between two dwarfed
stars. Granny, do you know when
they’ll come back? “No, baby, I
don’t, but it won’t be too
long.” And as I fell asleep, I
hoped she wasn’t wrong.
