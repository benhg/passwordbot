Yourself the Sun

By Arthur Gorges (1569-1625)

Yourself the sun, and I the
   melting frost,
Myself the flax and you the
   kindly fire,
Yourself the maze wherein my
   self is lost,
I your disdain, yet you my
   heartâ€™s desire,
Your love the port whereto my
   fancies sail,
My hope the ship whose helm your
   fair hand guides,
Your grace the wind that must my
   course avail
My faith the flood, your frowns
   the ebbing tides,
Yourself the spring and I the
   toiling bee.
My thoughts in you, though yours
   elsewhere, do rest.
You are the brook and I the deer
   embossed
My heaven is you, yet you
   torment my ghost.
