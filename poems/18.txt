If melancholy could have a smell

By: Bailey Uptain, '19

it might smell like the end of a
candle when it burns itself out.
Or like damp clothes that have
been waiting in the washing
machine for too long. Or like a
too-ripe banana sitting in a
basket among fresh apples. Or an
old hardcover book with water
damage. Or fog at 3 a.m. Or
boiled milk. Or it might smell
like all these things stewed
together in a simmering pot.
Maybe I would smell like these
things. My biggest fear would be
that maybe, it wouldnt smell
like anything at all.
