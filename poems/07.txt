I desperately wanted to spend
   time with you today
And it just didn't happen
You looked too good in a shirt I
   hadn't seen before.
One I knew you probably had
   something to say about.
A story to tell
But there wasn't a moment for
   you to volunteer it to me,
And me to smile quietly because
   I do actually want to listen.

There isn't time for me to be me
   with you being you
I put on clothes this morning
   with you in mind
Concocting an outfit you just
   might notice.

Instead I glimpsed you in
   passing, forgot to take a moment
   and ask
How are you?
Because you feel so steady and I
So wobble, and can't breathe and
   need your shoulder to hold me
   up.
You
So beautifully you in that shirt
   and your curls.

Tonight I left you and couldn't
   shake the feeling of your
   fingers on my cheek
How I'd kissed you and almost
   hit your head with my hat
I couldn't smile at you because
   I'd already started walking
   away.
Here I am writing in this moment
   that has already become tomorrow
The day is gone
No chance to be us
On a Thursday in February.
