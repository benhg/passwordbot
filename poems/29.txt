Eat Me

By Sydney Parker, '22

The summer air is as thick as
   warm pudding
Left out overnight on the
   kitchen counter.
The cicadas are howling.
I wish they would eat me.
If I were consumed entirely,
Would the cicadas still be
   snackish enough
To gnaw on the edges of my soul?
I wish that they
Would tear the sinews and fibers
Until there were no more,
Eating even the innards,
The bones, the brain, lapping up
   the fluids, slurping up the
   juice
Like a child slurps sweet milk
   from the bowl
At the end of her morning
   cereal.

But, of course, cicadas are not
   locusts.
They do not eat like locusts,
Nor like a child shoveling down
   her birthday cake.
So I bide my time,
Cicadas howling at me,
   knowingly,
While I think about them eating
   me
And ripping my chest open, bones
   cracking,
Blood and juice flowing.
Itâ€™s so sweet, and almost sour,
Acidic like half-rotten berry,
One that you should have tossed
   out, but ate anyways.
The cicadas howl on in spite of
   the gory images in my head.
Instead of the hungry bugs,
Will you sink your teeth into
   me?
