Lining

By: Grace Mark, '20

She turned away from herself And
towards the golden lining of the
clouds above Ascending into
sunset Not believing in moonlit
silver Still she found beauty
between dusk and dawn When she
was a girl she played connect
the dots with stars Creating
constellations She waited for
her story to be read between the
lines She moved to the mountains
so she couldn't be seen on the
edge of the horizon Where she
can reach the clouds from
mountain tops Searching for
sunset As she whispers sweet
nothings to thin air she wills
the wind to brush past her
cheeks Still she waits with
bated breath For the sky to
swallow her whole
