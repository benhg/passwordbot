Decay

By Arista Rawat Engineer, '19

sugars break down
into formless sludge
sharp and stinging

too-sweet smell of over ripe
   bananas
dark bruised skin molding to
   melting flesh
usurp the senses

odious fruit's ominous end

dreaded doppelganger snapshot of
   the future
we are what surrounds us

I check my body for spots.
