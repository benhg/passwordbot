If You Should Tire of Loving Me
Margaret Widdemer, 1884-1978


If you should tire of loving me
Some one of our far days,
Oh, never start to hide your heart
Or cover thought with praise.

For every word you would not say
Be sure my heart has heard,
So go from me all silently
Without a kiss or word;

For God must give you happiness...
And oh, it may befall
In listening long to Heaven-song
I may not care at all!
