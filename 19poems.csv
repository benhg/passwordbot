1,M,Of Many Worlds in This World,Margaret Cavendish (1623-1673),"Just like as in a nest of boxes round,
Degrees of sizes in each box are found:
So, in this world, may many others be
Thinner and less, and less still by degree:
Although they are not subject to our sense,
A world may be no bigger than two-pence.
Nature is curious, and such works may shape,
Which our dull senses easily escape:
For creatures, small as atoms, may there be,
If every one a creature’s figure bear.
If atoms four, a world can make, then see
What several worlds might in an ear-ring be:
For, millions of those atoms may be in
The head of one small, little, single pin.
And if thus small, then ladies may well wear
A world of worlds, as pendents in each ear.",,
2,T,Decay,"Arista Rawat Engineer, '19","sugars break down
into formless sludge

too-sweet smell of over ripe bananas
dark bruised skin molding to melting flesh

odious fruit’s ominous end

dreaded doppelganger snapshot of the future

I check my body for spots.",,
3,W,Yourself the Sun,Arthur Gorges (1569-1625),"Yourself the sun, and I the melting frost,
    Myself the flax and you the kindly fire,
Yourself the maze wherein my self is lost,
    I your disdain, yet you my heart’s desire,
Your love the port whereto my fancies sail,
    My hope the ship whose helm your fair hand guides,
Your grace the wind that must my course avail
    My faith the flood, your frowns the ebbing tides,
Yourself the spring and I the toiling bee.
    My thoughts in you, though yours elsewhere, do rest.
You are the brook and I the deer embossed
My heaven is you, yet you torment my ghost.",,
4,Th,San Ramon,"Riley Danger Brawn, '22","That summer in San Ramon, colors of yellow and green were at every corner:
avocados, mangos, chipping paint, rolling jungle hills, butterflies.
I walked past whistles and went deep into the neighborhood to the bakery with flies. I went out onto dirt roads with Juancito, placing skinned knees and elbows where they belonged. Fear took control of my bones, where people spoke in tongues at me in the dark. I always wished I had known the language. They brought me nutella and eggs, rabbits and dogs, coconuts and white pineapple. They washed my clothes and set my bed. They took me to the coffee plantation where I got bees stuck in my curls. My host mama, hermano, hermana, abuelo, abuela, tia, tio, y perro.
My days started with black coffee and Juancito’s cheeky smile. He joined us to eat jello from a bag, drink juice from a bucket, and eat rice from a pot. Juan walked me from the house to the hut of planting hope, as if he were older than me. He gave me his jacket often, though two sizes too small.
We lay on the roof of the crumbling building on a towel, looking at the sky’s unpolluted stars.
Bug spray in the air. “Te voy a extranar,” he cried.",,
5,F,A Drinking Song,W. B. Yeats (1865-1939),"Wine comes in at the mouth   
And love comes in at the eye;   
That’s all we shall know for truth   
Before we grow old and die.   
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh.

6,S,Aspiration,Henrietta Cordelia Ray (1849-1917),"We climb the slopes of life with throbbing heart,
And eager pulse, like children toward a star.
Sweet siren music cometh from afar,
To lure us on meanwhile. Responsive start
The nightingales to richer song than Art
Can ever teach. No passing shadows mar
Awhile the dewy skies; no inner jar
Of conflict bids us with our quest to part.
We see adown the distance, rainbow-arched,
What melting aisles of liquid light and bloom!
We hasten, tremulous, with lips all parched,
And eyes wide-stretched, nor dream of coming gloom.
Enough that something held almost divine
Within us ever stirs. Can we repine?",,
7,Su,Untitled,"Catherine Pendleton-Wheeler, '22","I desperately wanted to spend time with you today
And it just didn’t happen
You looked too good in a shirt I hadn’t seen before.
One I knew you probably had something to say about. 
A story to tell
But there wasn’t a moment for you to volunteer it to me, 
And me to smile quietly because I do actually want to listen.

There isn’t time for me to be me with you being you
I put on clothes this morning with you in mind
Concocting an outfit you just might notice.

Instead I glimpsed you in passing, forgot to take a moment and ask
How are you?
Because you feel so steady and I
So wobble, and can’t breathe and need your shoulder to hold me up.
You
So beautifully you in that shirt and your curls.

Tonight I left you and couldn’t shake the feeling of your fingers on my cheek
How I’d kissed you and almost hit your head with my hat
I couldn’t smile at you because I’d already started walking away.
Here I am writing in this moment that has already become tomorrow
The day is gone
No chance to be us 
On a Thursday in February.",,
8,M,The Bibliomanic's Prayer,Eugene Field (1850-1895),"Keep me, I pray, in wisdom’s way
  That I may truths eternal seek;
I need protecting care to-day,—
  My purse is light, my flesh is weak.
So banish from my erring heart
  All baleful appetites and hints
Of Satan’s fascinating art,
  Of first editions, and of prints.
Direct me in some godly walk
  Which leads away from bookish strife,
That I with pious deed and talk
  May extra-illustrate my life.

But if, O Lord, it pleaseth Thee
  To keep me in temptation’s way,
I humbly ask that I may be
  Most notably beset to-day;
Let my temptation be a book,
  Which I shall purchase, hold, and keep,
Whereon when other men shall look,
  They’ll wail to know I got it cheap.
Oh, let it such a volume be
  As in rare copperplates abounds,
Large paper, clean, and fair to see,
  Uncut, unique, unknown to Lowndes.

10,W,Smell!,William Carlos William (1883-1963),"Oh strong-ridged and deeply hollowed
nose of mine! what will you not be smelling?
What tactless asses we are, you and I, boney nose,
always indiscriminate, always unashamed,
and now it is the souring flowers of the bedraggled
poplars: a festering pulp on the wet earth
beneath them. With what deep thirst
we quicken our desires
to that rank odor of a passing springtime!
Can you not be decent? Can you not reserve your ardors
for something less unlovely? What girl will care
for us, do you think, if we continue in these ways?
Must you taste everything? Must you know everything?
Must you have a part in everything?",,
11,Th,When My Name is Clyfford,"Sophie March, '19","I am so handsome.
Don’t I look like my dad, when he was twenty and tall and grinning amidst
the green beans of his mother’s garden?
When his hair was short and his hands were calloused and
he was grinning.

Don’t I look like my dad and aren’t I handsome?
I look at the ankles of the boy sitting across from me,
his shoulders.
Do I look like the boy sitting across from me?
I cross my ankles, like him.

Do I look like my dad? 
I am almost twenty-two.
My hair is short and my hands are soft,
but in the summer I will make them hard and calloused.
In the summer the green beans will flower.
In the summer I will look like my dad.",,
12,F,dirty dust (der/die/das),"Ezri Reyes, '22","I live between the fluidity of nothing at all
and vastness of everything ever

Maybe bc there is something !there! in the blackness
(not the darkness).
Where white isn't light
and left is always right. 
I keep myself tucked
in bed and in check,
tightly buckled to an ejected seat
from an escape pod of a rocket-ship. 
When day is just night;
The kids !are! alright. 
I want to be loved
I need to be fucked

I'll buy you some boba with my haircut money",,title lower case?
13,S,Invitation to Love,Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906),"Come when the nights are bright with stars
   Or when the moon is mellow;
Come when the sun his golden bars
   Drops on the hay-field yellow.
Come in the twilight soft and gray,
Come in the night or come in the day,
Come, O love, whene’er you may,
   And you are welcome, welcome.

You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,
You are soft as the nesting dove.
Come to my heart and bring it rest
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.

Come when my heart is full of grief
   Or when my heart is merry;
Come with the falling of the leaf
   Or with the redd’ning cherry.
Come when the year’s first blossom blows,
Come when the summer gleams and glows,
Come with the winter’s drifting snows,
   And you are welcome, welcome.",,
14,Su,Talisman,Marianne Moore (1887-1972),"Under a splintered mast,

15,M,The Honey-Moon,"Bradley Ralph, '19","Mommy held my hand as we walked up the steps,
“We’re going to the honey-moon,” she said
 in the dark.
“Just me and your dad.”
As the red lights of the Camry disappeared into the night
I cried
while my protectors flew beyond my sight.
Granny held me close in her room, 
as I lay above the covers
Staring out between the iron columns welded to the window,
Up at the moon. 
Eyes tired,  
transfixed upon the sharp cheddar disc that hung 
above and between two dwarfed stars. 
Granny, do you know when they’ll come back? 
“No, baby, I don’t, 
but it won’t be too long.” 
And as I fell asleep, 
I hoped she wasn’t wrong. ",,
16,T,"He would not stay for me, and who can wonder",A. E. Housman (1859-1936),"He would not stay for me, and who can wonder?
  He would not stay for me to stand and gaze.
I shook his hand, and tore my heart in sunder,
  And went with half my life about my ways.",,
17,W,Lining,"Grace Mark, '20","She turned away from herself
And towards the golden lining of the clouds above
Ascending into sunset
Not believing in moonlit silver
 Still she found beauty between dusk and dawn

When she was a girl she played connect the dots with stars
Creating constellations
She waited for her story to be read between the lines

She moved to the mountains so she couldn't be seen on the edge of the horizon 
Where she can reach the clouds from mountain tops
Searching for sunset
As she whispers sweet nothings to thin air
she wills the wind to brush past her cheeks

Still she waits with bated breath 
For the sky to swallow her whole",,
18,Th,If melancholy could have a smell,"Bailey Uptain, '19","it might smell like the end of a candle when it burns itself out.
Or like damp clothes that have been waiting in the washing machine for too long.
Or like a too-ripe banana sitting in a basket among fresh apples.
Or an old hardcover book with water damage.
Or fog at 3 a.m.
Or boiled milk.
Or it might smell like all these things stewed together in a simmering pot.
Maybe I would smell like these things.
My biggest fear would be that maybe,
it wouldn’t smell like anything at all.",,
19,F,El Beso,Angelina Weld Grimke (1880-1958),"Twilight--and you
Quiet--the stars; 
Snare of the shine of your teeth, 
Your provocative laughter, 
The gloom of your hair; 
Lure of you, eye and lip; 
Yearning, yearning, 
Languor, surrender; 
Your mouth, 
And madness, madness, 
Tremulous, breathless, flaming, 
The space of a sigh; 
Then awakening--remembrance, 
Pain, regret--your sobbing; 
And again, quiet--the stars, 
Twilight--and you.",,
20,S,Credo,Alfred Kreymborg (1883-1966),"I sing the will to love:
the will that carves the will to live,
the will that saps the will to hurt,
the will that kills the will to die;
the will that made and keeps you warm,
the will that points your eyes ahead,
the will that makes you give, not get,
a give and get that tell us what you are:
how much a god, how much a human.
I call on you to live the will to love.",,
21,Su,Rain,"Jean Starr Untermeyer, 1886-1970","I have always hated the rain,
And the gloom of grayed skies.
But now I think I must always cherish
Rain-hung leaf and the misty river;
And the friendly screen of dripping green
Where eager kisses were shyly given
And your pipe-smoke made clouds in our damp, close heaven.
 
The curious laggard passed us by,
His wet shoes soughed on the shining walk.
And that afternoon was filled with a blurred glory—
That afternoon, when we first talked as lovers.",,

23,T,"Cymbeline, IV. ii. 258-81",William Shakespeare (1864-1616),"Fear no more the heat o’ the sun, 
Nor the furious winter’s rages; 
Thou thy worldly task hast done, 
Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages: 
Golden lads and girls all must, 
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust. 

Fear no more the frown o’ the great; 
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke; 
Care no more to clothe and eat; 
To thee the reed is as the oak: 
The scepter, learning, physic, must 
All follow this, and come to dust. 

Fear no more the lightning flash, 
Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone; 
Fear not slander, censure rash; 
Thou hast finished joy and moan: 
All lovers young, all lovers must 
Consign to thee, and come to dust. 

No exorciser harm thee! 
Nor no witchcraft charm thee! 
Ghost unlaid forbear thee! 
Nothing ill come near thee! 
Quiet consummation have; 
And renowned be thy grave!

24,W,duet partner,"Haley Wildhirt, '22","you used to write her duets
just to hear her voice float 
six steps above your baritone,
just to hear her say the words
you’d sugar-spun with love;
little candies to dissolve on
her tongue and absorb into
her bloodstream, which
as far as you knew, was the
most direct path to her heart.

you used to write her duets
laced with pseudonyms of
other girls’ names, girls you
had never met, girls you’d
used to help paint the facade
of who you hoped she was;
a seurat pointillism portrait
that only looked whole from afar.

you used to write her duets
but i was the one who sang them,
the one you trusted to critique,

The growing wheat, the growing weeds,
The toiling horses, the tired men;
The long empty roads,
Sullen fires of sunset, fading,

Flaming like the wild roses,
Singing like the larks over the plowed fields,

29,M,Eat Me,"Sydney Parker, '22","The summer air is as thick as warm pudding
Left out overnight on the kitchen counter.
The cicadas are howling.
I wish they would eat me.
If I were consumed entirely, 
Would the cicadas still be snackish enough 
To gnaw on the edges of my soul? 
I wish that they 
Would tear the sinews and fibers
Until there were no more, 
Eating even the innards, 
The bones, the brain, lapping up the fluids, slurping up the juice
Like a child slurps sweet milk from the bowl
At the end of her morning cereal.

But, of course, cicadas are not locusts.
They do not eat like locusts,
Nor like a child shoveling down her birthday cake.
So I bide my time, 
Cicadas howling at me, knowingly,
While I think about them eating me
And ripping my chest open, bones cracking,
Blood and juice flowing.
It’s so sweet, and almost sour,
Acidic like half-rotten berry,
One that you should have tossed out, but ate anyways.
The cicadas howl on in spite of the gory images in my head.
Instead of the hungry bugs, 
Will you sink your teeth into me?",,

I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

The last scud of day holds back for me,
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.

I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.

I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.

You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.

Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
Missing me one place search another,
I stop somewhere waiting for you.",,
